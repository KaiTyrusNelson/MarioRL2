# MarioRL2

MarioRL is an experiment of basic PPO improvements in the Super Mario Bros Enviroment. This REPO comes with basic training, eval code, as well as some pretrained models.

### Evaluation
Evaluation of the pretrained models can be done via the Evaluation.ipnyb notebook. This contains basic scripts for plotting results and recording videos. 
It currently is set up for pretrained models, but can be done for anything.

### Training
Training can be done via Training.ipnyb. Each of the cells cooresponds to a certain type of model, with specified heuristics.
